# hybrid_detection
Our hybrid marker detection method is based on the vision and CNN technics and proposes to enhance the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation of a landmark for autonomous landing of a quadcopter type UAV. The validate of method was made by simulating a fully autonomous landing compared to the state of the art results. The present paper focuses on proposes a robust hybrid detection method that overcomes long-range limitations and partial target occlusion without losing accuracy. In addition, the work assumes the unique use of onboard vision sensing to perform the landing task.
